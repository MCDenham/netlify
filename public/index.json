[{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Statistical terminology can be confusing. The terms confounding and aliasing were introduced by different researchers at different times during the development of experimental design theory. The two terms were introduced in subtly different contexts. The term confounding was introduced in the late 1920s by Ronald Fisher in the context of blocking experiments. It was used to describe the situation of deliberately “confounding” effects due to differences in blocks with typically higher order interactions between experimental factors to keep the size of a block to a manageable number. Later on, in the 1940s when fractional factorial designs were introduced by Finney, the term “aliasing” was used to describe the situation when two different factorial effects (such as two separate two-way interactions) could not be estimated separately from one another using the observed results from the experiment. There is little practical difference between these two situations and over time it has become widespread practice for the two terms to be used interchangeably. We will use the term “aliasing” throughout this discussion.\nTwo effects are aliased if their estimates are correlated with each other^1^. In the extreme case of perfect correlation (±1) it becomes mathematically impossible to discern the impact of one effect from the other using the data from the experiment. Fractional factorial designs do this on purpose. They lead to designs in which pairs of effects are either completely aliased (i.e. the estimates are perfectly correlated) or they are not aliased at all (i.e. the estimates have a correlation of zero). For instance, resolution IV fractional factorials have the property that estimates of main effects are uncorrelated with those of any other main effects or two-factor interactions. At the same time estimates of two-factor interactions will be perfectly correlated with estimates for some other two-factor interactions and uncorrelated with others. Prior information about what are likely to be the important effects can sometimes be used to choose designs where potentially important effects are only aliased with effects which are scientifically unlikely to exist. This reliance on both the observed data and our prior knowledge allows us to obtain the required information using fewer experimental resources. Fractional factorial designs have the desirable feature that they lead to a clear distinction of when estimated effects are unaffected by the size of other effects and when they are not.\nIt is also possible to create designs in which estimates of effects are correlated but not perfectly so. These designs allow us to mathematically tease out separate effects because their estimates are not perfectly correlated. Such effects are sometimes referred to as partially aliased. This can lead to misunderstandings when reading the literature; some authors use aliasing or confounding when they really mean complete aliasing. In our view, aliasing can refer to either complete or partial aliasing. The phrase “not completely aliased” (or equivalently not completely confounded) does not mean “not aliased” (or not confounded). Definitive Screening Designs are an example of a class of experimental designs which have partial aliasing. In these designs, main effects estimates are not aliased with each other or with any two-factors interactions or quadratic effects. At the same time, two-factor interactions and quadratic effect estimates are partially aliased with each other. This partial aliasing makes interpretation of the uncertainty associated with effect estimates much more difficult. It also makes choosing an appropriate model more difficult. Even though pairs of effects may not be perfectly correlated with each other, it can still be mathematically impossible to distinguish between the overall impact of two different sets of effects.\n\r^1^This isn’t entirely true. I guess strictly speaking the two effects are aliased if the associated columns of the design matrix are not orthogonal. When we have two columns that are linearly dependent, we generally include one effect and not the other. The estimated effect is then biased. (We do not have an estimator for the other term, so we cannot talk about the correlation between them.) When we have partial aliasing and we fit both terms we have correlation but no bias due to the partially aliased effect.\nOne could think of this as dividing the design matrix into separate sub-matrices where \\(X_1\\) represents effects included in the model and \\(X_2\\) represents terms effects not included in the model. Note \\(X_2\\) can include any effect not included in the model. These can be explicitly omitted main effects, higher order terms not explicitly considered or even effects associated with unknown process factors.\n\\[y = X_1{\\vec\\beta_1} + X_2\\vec\\beta_2 + \\epsilon\\]\nWe estimate \\(\\vec\\beta_1\\) as \\(\\hat \\beta_1 = \\left(X_1^TX_1\\right)^{-1}X_1^Ty\\), so that\n\\[E\\left[\\hat \\beta_1\\right] = \\vec\\beta_1 + \\left(X_1^TX_1\\right)^{-1}X_1^TX_2\\vec\\beta_2\\]\rand\r\\[V\\left[\\hat \\beta_1\\right] = \\left(X_1^TX_1\\right)^{-1}\\sigma^2.\\]\nIf \\(X_1^TX_2 = 0\\) then \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\) is an unbiased estimate regardless of the values of \\(\\vec\\beta_2\\).\nIf \\(X_1^TX_2 \\ne 0\\) then \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\) is a biased estimate unless \\(\\vec\\beta_2 = \\vec0.\\)\nFor the \\(j\\)th coefficient in \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\) (i.e. \\(\\beta_{1j}\\)) to be unbiased for the corresponding coefficient in \\(\\vec\\beta_1\\), for each value of \\(k\\), one or other of \\(\\left[\\left(X_1^TX_1\\right)^{-1}X_1^TX_2\\right]_{jk}\\) and \\(\\beta_{2k}\\) must be equal to zero.\n","date":1541721600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541721600,"objectID":"4085ce9bc75f74b9a6f7860f19efa4fe","permalink":"/post/understanding-confounding-and-aliasing/","publishdate":"2018-11-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/understanding-confounding-and-aliasing/","section":"post","summary":"Statistical terminology can be confusing.

This is another set of terms that seem to get used somewhat interchangeably. Again I believe there are some subtle (and this time important) differences in their meaning and implications.\rMcCullagh and Nelder used the term “marginality” in their seminal work on generalised linear models. Their idea has its roots in Taylor series expansions.\nTo illustrate let’s temporarily imagine a world with no statistical error. We have a response variable \\(y\\) whose value can be determined from the value of a single explanatory variable \\(x\\) through a functional relationship \\(y=f(x)\\). Let us suppose that this function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous and differentiable but not necessarily polynomial. We can express \\(f(x)\\) using an infinite Taylor series expansion about an arbitrary point \\(x_0\\):\n\\[y = f(x_0) + \\left.{df(x)\\over dx}\\right|_{x_0} \\times (x-x_0) + {1\\over 2!} \\left.d^2 f(x)\\over dx^2\\right|_{x_0}\\times(x-x_0)^2 + \\ldots \\]\nWe can create approximations of \\(f(x)\\) using finite Taylor series expansions. For example, a quadratic polynomial approximation would use\n\\[y= a_0 + b_0 \\times (x-x_0) + c_0 \\times (x-x_0)^2\\]\nwith \\(a_0=f(x_0 )\\); \\(b_0= {df(x)\\over dx}|_{x_0}\\); \\(c_0={1\\over 2!} {d^2 f(x)\\over dx^2}|_{x_0}\\).\nNow let’s suppose we have a pure quadratic relationship, \\(y =\\alpha +\\gamma x^2\\). In our Taylor series expansion, we have \\(a_0 =\\alpha +\\gamma x_0^2\\), \\(b_0 =\\gamma x_0\\) and \\(c_0 =\\gamma\\). Assuming \\(\\gamma \\ne 0\\), then the linear term is only zero when we choose \\(x_0\\) to be zero. In other words if we shift the “origin” of the \\(x\\) variable the relationship ceases to be a purely quadratic one. Since for most covariates the definition of what constitutes “zero” is arbitrary, it does not make any sense to omit the linear term when fitting the quadratic. I believe, this is what McCullagh and Nelder mean when they refer to marginality. Note that this interpretation has absolutely nothing to do with the statistical significance of the terms or their magnitude, it is about preserving the behaviour of the implied model under changes of location and scale in the covariate.\nA similar argument can be applied in the context of factorial models and effects. The principle of marginality drives a requirement to include relevant lower order terms when fitting higher order terms. Except in rare circumstances where the “zero” setting of a factor is not arbitrary, fitting a two-factor interaction requires the inclusion of the corresponding main effects to preserve the behaviour of the model in changes of location. Similarly, modelling three-factor interactions requires the inclusion of the relevant set of two-factor interactions and main effects. Again, this principle has nothing to do with believing the significance or magnitude of effects decreases with increasing order. [I’ve omitted the mathematical expressions for now, but who knows, I might put them in at some point - MCD]\nA hierarchical model is one which obeys the principle of marginality. When you only select BF and F terms in a half normal plot using DX10, DX10 issues a warning to say the model you have selected is not hierarchical. It does not provide a warning if you select B, F and BF terms and the magnitude of the estimated BF effect is bigger than the estimated main effects for B and F.\nOn the other hand, the terms effect hierarchy, effect sparsity and effect heredity popularised by Hamada and Wu relate to the relative importance of effects and the abundance of relatively important effects. The idea of effect hierarchy is that lower order effects are more likely to be important than higher order effects and that effects of the same order are equally likely to be important. The idea of effect sparsity is essentially a restatement of the Pareto Principle in the context of experimental design. It posits that the number of relatively important effects in an experiment is small. Finally effect heredity is more of a model fitting principle where a higher order effect can only be deemed significant if the relevant lower order effects are also significant. Particularly in the context of two-factor interactions, this is sometimes referred to as the strong heredity principle to distinguish it from a relaxed version known as weak heredity where a two-factor interaction can be deemed significant if only one of the relevant main effects is significant.\nI am not clear whether significant is being used to mean practically important or whether it is being used to mean statistically significant. It seems to me that Hamada and Wu interpret it both ways as it suits them. Hamada and Wu use the principles to motivate a proposed model selection strategy based on forward selection. Forward selection has some well-known difficulties associated with adding terms one at a time and only if they are statistically significant at a threshold level. These difficulties are perhaps the motivation for the concept of effect heredity based on statistical significance as it can then be used as a justification for the forward selection strategy.\nI would argue that except in rare circumstances chosen models should obey M\u0026amp;N’s marginality principle. Best possible subsets approaches using criteria such as AICc where the subset models considered obey the marginality principle combined with subject matter knowledge would seem to me to be far better approaches than relying on H\u0026amp;W’s effect heredity and forward selection.\n","date":1541721600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541721600,"objectID":"760c7117945bf068d5ba4fcb86d26606","permalink":"/post/understanding-marginality-and-effect-hierarchy-sparsity-heredity/","publishdate":"2018-11-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/understanding-marginality-and-effect-hierarchy-sparsity-heredity/","section":"post","summary":"Did I mention that statistical terminology can be confusing?
